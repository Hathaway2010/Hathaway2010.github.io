          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>For years after finishing my bachelor's in English lit at Harvard, I lived my dream: I worked at an independent bookstore while writing, translating Russian poetry, and painting on the side. But I wondered what I was missing in the quantitative, technical world. COVID gave me the opportunity I needed: I taught myself to code.
          <p>I've been learning as fast as I can since November 2020. I can create algorithms and data visualizations in Python and JavaScript, as well as web apps using React, Flask, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've earned four certificates from freeCodeCamp, which entails building a number of web apps from scratch — freeCodeCamp estimates these certificates to require 1200 hours of work. I have also completed seven certificates from Coursera, including a four-course Python sequence from Rice University.</p>
          <p>Most recently, I completed Harvard's CS50x, the MOOC version of their introduction to computer science, and CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. As a final project, I built a poetry scansion app that generates automated scansions (patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables) of public-domain poems, lets users train against human scansions, and allows qualified users to train the app.</p>
          <p>The pandemic created space in my life to do what I love — learn and solve complex problems while interacting with creative and engaging people.</p>
